**Debugging Analysis**

**Scenario 1: Modify Branch Issue**
- **Breakpoint Location**: branch.controller.ts, line 64
- **Objective**: Debug why modifying a branch may fail
- **Debugger Observations**
- Variable States:
- id: Captured from req.params.id
- updates: Retrieved from req.body
- updatedBranch: Result of updateBranch(id, updates)

**Call Stack**:
- modifyBranch → updateBranch → Firestore call
- Behavior:
- If updatedBranch is null, the response returns Branch not found (404).
- If successful, the response returns Branch updated successfully (200).
**Analysis**
- The issue might be that the id doesn’t exist in Firestore.
- Verify if updateBranch correctly handles the update operation.
- Ensure id is correctly passed and matches an existing branch.

**Scenario 2: Remove Branch Issue**
- Breakpoint Location: branch.controller.ts, line 84
- Objective: Debug why branch deletion might fail
**Debugger Observations**
- Variable States:
- id: Captured from req.params.id
- success: Result of deleteBranch(id)

**Call Stack**:
- removeBranch → deleteBranch → Firestore call
- Behavior:
- If success is false, response returns Branch not found (404).
- If successful, response returns Branch deleted successfully (200).
**Analysis**
- The id may not exist in Firestore, leading to a 404.
- Ensure deleteBranch properly checks if a branch exists before deletion.
- Add logs to confirm the id is correctly retrieved.

**Scenario 3: Remove Employee Issue**
- Breakpoint Location: employee.controller.ts, line 124
- Objective: Investigate why employee deletion may fail
**Debugger Observations**
- Variable States:
- id: Captured from req.params.id
- success: Result of deleteEmployee(id)

**Call Stack**:
- removeEmployee → deleteEmployee → Firestore call
- Behavior:
- If success is false, response returns Employee not found (404).
- If successful, response returns Employee deleted successfully (200).
**Analysis**
- The employee id may not exist in Firestore.
- Ensure deleteEmployee checks if the employee exists before deletion.
- Add logging to confirm the id passed matches a valid employee record.
