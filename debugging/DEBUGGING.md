# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Debugging Employee Retrieval by Department

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employee.controller.ts`, **Line 36**
- **Objective:** Verify that the correct department employees are being retrieved and that the response is properly formatted.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `department`: Retrieved correctly from req.params.department
  - `employees`: Contains an array of employees belonging to the specified department
- **Call Stack:**
  - getEmployeesByDepartment(req, res) function is triggered.
  - Calls employee_service.getEmployeesByDepartment(department).
  - Response is processed and returned to the client.
- **Behavior:**
  - If no employees are found, the API returns a 404 error.
  - If employees are found, they are returned as an array in JSON format.

### Analysis

- The department filter is working as expected.
- No unexpected behavior was observed.
- Potential improvement: Implement better error handling for edge cases, such as invalid department names.

## Scenario 2: Debugging Employee Update Operation

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employee.controller.ts`, **Line 72**
- **Objective:** Validate the employee update process and ensure correct data modification.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `id`: Retrieved correctly from req.params.id and converted to a number.
  - `updates`: Extracted from req.body, containing the updated employee fields.
  - `updatedEmployee`: Either returns the updated employee or null if the employee is not found.
- **Call Stack:**
  - modifyEmployee(req, res) function is triggered.
  - Calls employee_service.updateEmployee(id, updates).
  - If the employee is found and updated, the response returns the modified employee data.
- **Behavior:**
  - If the provided id is invalid, an error response is returned (400 Bad Request).
  - If the employee does not exist, a 404 Not Found response is sent.
  - If the update is successful, the updated employee data is returned.

### Analysis

- The employee update functionality is working correctly.
- Observed no major issues, but validation should be strengthened for required fields.
- Potential improvement: Consider adding logging for failed update attempts to track potential issues.

## Scenario 3: Debugging Branch Retrieval by ID

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branch.controller.ts`, **Line 12**
- **Objective:** Ensure that branch retrieval by ID is working correctly and handles errors properly.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `id`: Retrieved from req.params.id and converted to a number.
  - `branch`: Retrieved from branch_service.getBranchById(id), either returning a branch object or null.
- **Call Stack:**
  - getBranch(req, res) function is executed.
  - Calls branch_service.getBranchById(id).
  - If the branch exists, its details are returned.
- **Behavior:**
  - If the id is not a valid number, a 400 Bad Request response is returned.
  - If the branch is not found, a 404 Not Found response is sent.
  - If the branch exists, it is returned in JSON format.

### Analysis

- Branch retrieval by ID is functioning as expected.
- No unexpected behavior was observed.
- Potential improvement: Improve error messages to provide more details.
